An operating system (OS) is the software that manages the hardware and software resources of a computer and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the computer hardware and the applications or programs being executed by the user. The operating system provides a platform for executing applications, allocating and managing memory, managing input/output operations, and controlling security and access to shared resources. Some of the most popular operating systems include Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, Linux, and Google Android. Each operating system has its own unique features, user interface, and set of system services. The choice of operating system depends on the specific needs and requirements of the user and the hardware platform being used.
