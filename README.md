The Banker's Algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems to prevent deadlocks. 
It helps to ensure the safe allocation of resources (such as CPU time, memory, and I/O devices) among multiple processes.
The algorithm uses a table to keep track of the maximum and currently allocated resources for each process, 
and it makes sure that the allocation of resources will always leave the system in a safe state, 
where it is guaranteed that no deadlocks will occur. 
If a process requests a resource that would leave the system in an unsafe state,
the request is temporarily denied until sufficient resources become available.

The process of the Banker's Algorithm can be summarized as follows:

Initialization: The algorithm starts by initializing the available resource table, which keeps track of the total number of each resource in the system, 
and the maximum and current resource table, which keeps track of the maximum and currently allocated resources for each process.

Resource Request: When a process requests a resource, the algorithm checks if the request can be granted by comparing the request with 
the available resource table and the current resource table.

Safety Check: If the resource request leaves the system in an unsafe state, the request is denied. To determine the safety of the system, 
the algorithm uses the safety algorithm, which checks if there exists a sequence of processes such that each process can obtain all its requested
resources.

Allocation: If the system is in a safe state, the requested resources are allocated to the process, and the current resource table is updated accordingly.

Release: When a process releases a resource, the algorithm updates the available resource table and the current resource table
to reflect the new resource availability.

Repeat: The algorithm repeats the process of resource request and allocation until all processes have completed or the system reaches a deadlock.

The Banker's Algorithm provides a way to ensure the safe allocation of resources and avoid deadlocks in operating systems.
It is widely used in computer systems and is considered one of the most efficient algorithms for deadlock avoidance.
